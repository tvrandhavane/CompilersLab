My Changes:

In ast.cc:
1.	Added function compile_and_optimize_ast in Relational_Expr_Ast, If_Else_Ast and Goto_Ast
2.	Modified the function compile_and_optimize_ast in Assignment_ast so as to not apply any optimization if RHS is relational_ast and free up a register when lhs's register is not null.

In icode.cc:
1.	Added print_assembly function to Label_IC_Stmt, Compute_IC_Stmt, Control_Flow_IC_Stmt.

In parser.yy:
1.	Added a check for valid basic block numbers in goto_statement.

In procedure.cc:
1.	Added a function to check for valid basic block numbers in goto_statement.

In procedure.hh:
1.	Added a list to store the number of basic block numbers used in goto_statement.
2.	Added a function declaration to check for valid basic block numbers in goto_statement.

In reg_alloc.cc:
1.	Added a function is_unique_lra_symbol to check whether the register is allocated to more than one symbol.
2.	Added an if condition for Number_ast in mc_2r case of optimize_lra to set the register to NULL in that case.
3.	Added NULL checks for destination_register and destination_symbol_entry in optimiza_lra.

In reg_alloc.hh:
1.	Added the function declaration is_unique_lra_symbol.
