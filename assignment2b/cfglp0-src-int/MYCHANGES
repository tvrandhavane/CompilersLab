My Changes:

In scanner.ll:
1.	We have added new tokens for <, >, >=, <=, ==, != , &&, ||.
2.	Added token to identify starting of a basic block (for example, <bb 5>).
	This token returns the id number of the basic block.

In parser.yy:
1. 	Uncommented all of C code.

2. 	Modified the grammar of basic_block to accomodate the token created for basic block.

3. 	Added action routine for goto_statement, if-else statement and relational expression

4.	Added precedence and priority for the relational operators.

In ast.hh:
1.	Added the declaration for Relational_Expr_Ast, If_Else_Ast, Goto_Ast

2.	Added enumerator for Relational operators.

In ast.cc:
1.	Added the class for Relational_Expr_Ast, If_Else_Ast, Goto_Ast

2.	Modified Assignment_Ast class to make the RHS of type Relational_Expr_Ast.

In basic-block.cc:
1.	Added a variable successor to store the id of the successor basic block. Needed for if-else statements.

2.	The successor variable is modified in the evaluate function, it contains the value of the successor from the last statement of the block. If invalid, it contains -1.

In procedure.cc:
1.	Modified the get_next_bb function to give the appropriate successor basic block according to the condition of if-else clause.
